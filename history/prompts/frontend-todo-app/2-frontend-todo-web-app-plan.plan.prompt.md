```

## Response Text

Completed the planning phase for the Frontend - Phase II Todo Web App. Created the following artifacts:

1. Implementation plan (plan.md) - Outlining the technical approach and project structure
2. Research document (research.md) - Covering technology choices and research findings
3. Data model (data-model.md) - Defining entities, relationships, and DTOs
4. API contract (contracts/api-contract.md) - Specifying the API endpoints and request/response formats
5. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) - Providing setup and development instructions

All required artifacts have been created following the specification requirements. The plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing the frontend application with authentication, task management, and responsive design.
